Added functioning DFS implementation, that shows the taken path and all visited tiles
Edit:
The DFS was implemented recursively, which turns out to be a problem at larger gridsizes. Python crashes after about
(very roughly) 600 recursive calls. (Stackoverflow said about a 1000 calls)

Error Message:
Fatal Python error: _Py_CheckRecursiveCall: Cannot recover from stack overflow.
Python runtime state: initialized

To fix this, I will probably have to implement the algorithm iteratively
